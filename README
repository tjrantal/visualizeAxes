Quaternion rotation of arrows.

I will use the code to visualize the orientation of an inertial motion unit (IMU) comprising a tri-axial accelerometer and a tri-axial gyroscope from an Octave code. The Octave code will compute orientation quaternion of the IMU, and feed the orientation quaternion into this java class.

Got the basics from Kai Ruhl's JOGL demos http://www.land-of-kain.de/docs/jogl/

Quaternion.java is copied from http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/32class/Quaternion.java.html, modified to allow access to x0 to x3.

Obviously depends on jogl (http://jogamp.org/jogl/www/), which in turn depends on gluegen. Native windows libraries are included with the code.
